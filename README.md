# Predicting Faults in Nigerian Transmission Lines with Machine Learning

Description:
This project utilizes machine learning to forecast faults in Nigerian transmission lines, enhancing the reliability of the country's power grid. Employing three algorithms - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) - on a dataset of 179 observations and 11 features, we evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results highlight QDA's superior performance, suggesting its adoption for real-time fault prediction. Suggestions for further optimization and model enhancement are also provided, aiming to continuously improve grid stability and infrastructure resilience. The project's code and datasets are openly available, facilitating reproducibility and encouraging ongoing research in power grid management.
